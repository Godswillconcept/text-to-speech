Here's a detailed outline for creating a full-stack text-to-speech application with the specified technologies:

Application Overview

The application will provide the following features:

1. Text-to-Speech Conversion: Convert text from a text field to audio.
2. PDF-to-Speech Conversion: Convert PDF files to audio.
3. Audio Preview and Download: Allow users to preview and download generated audio files.
4. Text Paraphrasing: Paraphrase text from a text field and PDF files.
5. Text Summarization: Summarize text from a text field and PDF files.
6. Stored Operations Retrieval: Retrieve previously performed operations.

Client (React with Vite)

1. Setup a new Vite project with React.
2. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and Headless UI for accessible components.
3. Implement animations using a library like Framer Motion or React Transition Group.
4. Create components for:
    - Text input field
    - PDF upload and processing
    - Audio player and download
    - Paraphrasing and summarization tools
    - Stored operations retrieval

API (Node.js with Sequelize and MySQL)

1. Setup a new Node.js project with Express.js.
2. Configure Sequelize with MySQL for database operations.
3. Implement authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), sessions, and express-flash for notifications.
4. Use express-validator for input validation.
5. Create API endpoints for:
    - Text-to-speech conversion
    - PDF-to-speech conversion
    - Paraphrasing and summarization
    - Stored operations retrieval
    - User authentication and management

AI Models

1. Integrate the Gemini AI model for text paraphrasing and summarization.
2. Use a text-to-speech model like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or Amazon Polly for audio generation.

Database Schema

1. Users table: store user information and authentication details.
2. Operations table: store previously performed operations (text-to-speech, paraphrasing, summarization, etc.).
3. Audio files table: store generated audio files.

API Endpoints

1. /text-to-speech: Convert text to audio.
2. /pdf-to-speech: Convert PDF to audio.
3. /paraphrase: Paraphrase text.
4. /summarize: Summarize text.
5. /operations: Retrieve stored operations.
6. /login: Authenticate user.
7. /register: Register new user.

Implementation Roadmap

1. Setup frontend and backend projects.
2. Implement authentication and user management.
3. Develop text-to-speech and PDF-to-speech features.
4. Integrate AI models for paraphrasing and summarization.
5. Implement stored operations retrieval.
6. Test and deploy the application.

This outline provides a solid foundation for building a full-stack text-to-speech application with the specified features and technologies.


# Full-Stack Text-to-Speech Application API

## Notes
- The backend will be a Node.js application using Express.js.
- Sequelize will be used as the ORM for a MySQL database.
- Authentication will be handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), sessions, and `express-flash` for notifications.
- Input validation will be performed using `express-validator`.
- AI functionalities will be provided by the Gemini AI model for text manipulation and a service like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or Amazon Polly for audio generation.
- The project structure is now in place, including models, routes, controllers, and services.
- User authentication and TTS/PDF-to-Speech functionalities are implemented.
- AI text manipulation features (paraphrase, summarize, key points, change tone) are implemented.
- The `package.json` has been updated with all required dependencies and scripts for linting, formatting, and database management.
- Project documentation (`README.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`) and a `.gitignore` file have been created.
- Database migrations have been created to set up the database schema.
- A `test-api.js` script has been created to perform integration tests on the API endpoints.
- Google Cloud Text-to-Speech is not yet configured. Testing will focus on the AI text manipulation features first.
- The server was crashing on startup due to a `SequelizeDatabaseError`. This was fixed by correcting model associations. A new script (`test-db-connection.js`) confirms the database is connected and the schema is correct. However, the main server process exits silently after startup. Debugging has narrowed the problem down to the `src/routes/auth.js` file. Several test scripts (`test-routes.js`, `test-auth-routes-isolated.js`) hang when trying to load this file, even though the controller and middleware it uses seem to work in isolation. The next step is to add very granular logging inside `src/routes/auth.js` to find the exact point of failure.
- User has requested to switch focus to testing the AI endpoints using `test-ai-endpoints.js` before resolving the server startup issue.
- Since the server is unstable, the AI endpoints will be tested by calling the AI controller functions directly, bypassing the need for a running server for now.
- The AI controller functions for text manipulation have been successfully tested directly using `test-ai-controller.js`. This confirms the Gemini AI integration is working.
- The `test-tts-controller.js` script was created to test TTS functionality directly. Initial runs failed due to missing credentials (`ENOENT` error). The script has been progressively enhanced to automatically find `gcloud` credentials and to provide extremely detailed error logging and step-by-step instructions for resolving authentication issues. The continued failures strongly indicate an environment configuration problem that requires user intervention (e.g., setting `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` correctly, or logging in via `gcloud`).
- A manual test script (`test-ai-manual.js`) has been created for the AI endpoints.
- A database connection test script (`test-db.js`) has been created to isolate potential database issues.
